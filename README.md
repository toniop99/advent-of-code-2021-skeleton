# Skeleton Advent Of Code 2021

Welcome to the advent of code 2021!!

To quickly start coding the challenge with **JavaScript** you can use this project to avoid to create the boilerplate to store all the project.

## Installation

- Clone the project

- ``npm install``
- ``npm run prepare`` # Create the project structure under src folder. 
**Don't use it if you already have code written in src!!!**

- Start coding

## Usage

Start coding on ``index.js`` of the current challenge day and write test if you want in the test file.

- With ``npm test`` run all the test of the project.
- With ``npm test {src/folder}`` run the test of this folder.
- With ``npm run runDay {day} {part}`` run the index.js of the folder of the ``day`` specified as argument and the ``part`` specified as second argument.
- With ``npm run processInput {day} {part}`` process the input.txt of the folder of the ``day`` specified as argument and the ``part`` specified as second argument to convert the data separated by \n into an array on ``input.js``.


## Good coding!
